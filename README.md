Sonic Views - Peaks is a Max/MSP patch that takes incoming sound from the computer's microphone, stores the highest value for each second and prints it as a colored cell going from black (quiet) to white (loud) on a matrix made of 24 columns (hours) and 3600 rows (seconds).

The project is an iteration on my piece [Sonic Views](https://http://www.lucaderosso.com/expo/sonic-views/), where digital prints where generated by printing samples amplitude values on a matrix made of a number of cells equal to the number of samples in the audio used. The work is meant to be an art piece to work as a public or private installation, and idea that came to me in 2016 while workin on the first series of Sonic Views. While the idea is original of the author aka myself, it is always thans to communities and that things take shape or they do it so fast. So I thought I'd share the patch for others to experiment and puild on it.

## Getting started

Just download the patch open it with Max or the runtime and press the button yelling "ACTIVATE"

The patch will start printing in the position according to the current time of the day. The matrix is organized in 24 columns each of which has 3600 cells. The leftmost column is 00:00 the rightmost is 23:00. Say you are starting the patch at 12:30 then you'll be getting some values printed around the middle of the patch. 

If you see nothing printed that's because the space you're in is not loud enough. Make some noise. Clap your hands, you get it.

## Output

If you let the patch running for 24 hours you'll get something like this:
